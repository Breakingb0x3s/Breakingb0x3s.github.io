        Hello, my name is Riley Robinson, and I am on my journey to becoming a professional software engineer.
        I chose to pursue this career to take advantage of both my creativity and my critical thinking.
        On this page I've included samples of my artwork, projects, and a small bio.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of my favorite past times include reading comics, playing video games with family and friends, boxing, drawing, and
        now my new favorite hobby, writing code. 
        I chose to share some

        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <p>10/18/22 - Hungry as I type this.  So I'm going to make an effort to put
            more updates on this as it evolves as a time stamp on things.  
            This should by extension force me to build a time stamp into 
            this portfolio.  
            <ul>
                <li>Played around with hover on links</li>
                <li>Matched more of the color scheme</li>
                <li>Added an updates section</li>
            </ul>
            10/19/22 - Success! Finished making my first style reference page and linked
            it to the page as my second project.  Some of the code is a little rough but I 
            got the general idea on how to make these going forward.
            <br>
            <br>
            10/22/22 - Color theory is kinda silly, it's important to a degree but having
            come from an art background it seems second nature and no duh for professional 
            builds but very limiting for messing around and breaking things.
            <br>
            <br>
            10/23/22 - Started my 3rd project which is my first project not brought on by my studies.
            I decided I wanted to make a forum.  Figured it'd be mostly html and css which has been the bulk of
            my initial studies, but it also introduced me to connecting javascript to a webpage so that's neat.
            I got the design portion down, have to go through the rest of the tutorial to complete.  Will link to
            projects after it's completed.
            <br>
            <br>
            10/25/22 - Okay so I made the forum with the help of a tutorial.  Also learned some 
            text design/theory on codecademy.  Going to attempt some codewar challenges before bed.
            <br>
            <br>
            10/26/2022 - Learned about flex attributes today, currently on flex-shrink.  Need to learn to apply this to the web page.
            Although I'm not sure if I want to just start a new one or play with this one some more?
            <br>
            <br>
            10/28/2022 - Went through some of my CSS and adjusted the gallery, the hover feature for the images had the 
            width removed to make for an easier hover experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            10/30/2022 - Just finished a cafe web page project, had several moments where I wanted to quit.
            Got over it and actually did a damn good job.  Still trying to circumvent having to use the background-image tool 
            simply because it seems to make the image disappear completely when I run it in debug mode, but seems to work in live mode
            I'll get to the bottom of if it's working or not when I test my gitHub later tonight.
            <br>
            <br>
            11/6/2022 - Been a minute since I played around with the portfolio but I just converted the main image
            to a background image with a grid overlay.  This let's me put text, other images or so on over it in an organized manner.
            I think this can be done with flex boxes too but I'm having fun doing this through grids it just feels more organized.
            <br>
            <br>
            11/7/2022 - I need to step up my game a bit.  I just realized how limited my knoweledge is on codewars.
            I came across a problem and almost immediatley thought of a solution, I even patted myself on the back 
            thinking that I had outdone myself by taking input value into account, and it worked.  My code passed all the stress tests, but when I saw the top
            answer my heart dropped.  They did what took me possibly 20 lines of code in only 3.  What kills me is not that I didn't know 
            the exact method at the time, it was that I didn't think to search for that method at the start.  
            I was so confident in my knoweledge I didn't think to check if there was an easier way.  So, I need 
            to keep an open mind to the possiblity that a solution I come up with may not be the best solution and to reasearch
            before committing code.
            <ul>
                <li>Added a green box to the Zune image</li>
                <li>Going to adjust the gallery to be responsive to cell phone and tv sizes(never know where you're going to work)</li>
                <li>Realized I can't wait to figure out how to parse out these updates instead of having a long running html list</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            12/28/2022 - Despite the lack of updates I have not given up on coding.  
            Currently taking a break from my CodeCademy courses. So updates on what I've learned since playing around with the CSS grid mapping.              
            I've learned about posts and get reqeusts, I've also learned about CSS transitions which I plan to implement on the Aperature Labs page, I also need to add animation to the cyber eye.           
            A huge update I need to do is make this page interactive by making a posting area to more easily post these updates without VScode.             My next big idea is a Sleuth the bot, I'll go into more info on this once I have a prototype built but I'm excited about the idea.             Another project I have to work on is just an automated math worksheet, but the big test of this update is to test my git and git hub knowledge.
            I'm attempting to update my portfolio from the chromebook instead of Rock.
            <br>
            <br>
            12/29/2022 - Success! Note, VS Code made this a lot easier than my class lead me to believe.
            Which is fine, and I also have to remember all I really did was a simple post update but glad to put some of my learning to use.
